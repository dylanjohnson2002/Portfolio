                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p> Hello, my name is Dylan Johnson, and I'm currently embracing the exciting world of gaming and
                        interactive
                        media in my second year at Boise State's GIMM program. With a burning passion for game design, I
                        am
                        enthusiastically diving into the intricacies of creating engaging and immersive gaming
                        experiences. Outside
                        the digital realm, I also take a lot of care in my job at a local pet store, where I dedicate
                        my time to
                        caring for animals.My technological curiosties and a love for animals defines who I
                        am and
                        continuously shapes my journey in life.

                    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
                    <p>I am originally from the small city of North Pole Alaska! My family moved there in 2003, and I
                        grew up there until I graduated high school. It is located in the very interior of Alaska. There
                        is definitely not much to do up there if you don't enjoy hunting and fishing! It is extremely
                        dry and cold with winters reaching almost -50 degrees below zero! Below, I attached a picture of
                        one of North Pole's attractions, the Santa Claus House.In 2020 Me and my whole family
                        moved to Boise, Idaho in the search for someplace warmer. We quickly fell in love with the area,
                        and I chose to go to Boise State University in the fall of that year. I greatly enjoy Idaho
                        because of the much more pleasant weather, and the fact that it has many of the outdoor
                        activities that Alaska does, while offering much more to do outside of that.</p>

                    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>In my free time, I love to play video games, watch movies, along with various outdoor activites
                        such as fishing and hiking. Growing up in Alaska taught me how important and fun it can be to
                        spend time outdoors. My family and I are very much into fishing as Alaska has some of the best
                        fishing in the world. We still very much enjoy fishing in Idaho as well. As well as playing
                        video games and being outdoors, one of my hobbies is keeping aquariums. I am a huge animal lover
                        and have always been obsessed with underwater life. My current job at petco is what convinced me
                        to start the aquarium hobby. I began keeping aquariums a couple years ago, and now currently
                        have 3 tanks set up. One of them is a saltwater tank with clownfish!</p>

                    <h2>Why I Chose GIMM</h2>
                    <p>I chose to pursue a degree in GIMM because I love video games and wanted to learn about the
                        process that goes into making them. I've always found it a fascinating field and I am hoping to
                        land a career in it. I primarily am focused on learning how to operate Unity, and how to
                        creat/animate 3D envrionments and creatures. I am working on building up my skills in these
                        specific areas as Boise State teaches me how to use software such as Blender and Maya. I have
                        some experience creating low-poly envrionments and am currently learning how to create more
                        complex environments and creatures using 3D tools. The world of video game creation and
                        animation is amazing and I am excited to explore it further!</p>

                    <h3>Unity 2D Platformer</h3>
                    <p>This very first project was my first ever project in the GIMM program at Boise State. This is a
                        very basic Sci-Fi themed game where the player is an astronaut trying to escape from a giant
                        ship. This is a basic 2D platformer with lots of obstacles such as large gaps, spikes, and
                        falling platforms. There are also many coins to collect throught the levels as well! This
                        project was many using Unity, Visual Studio, and I also used Photoshop to create sprites and
                        animations. This project was fun to create as it was really exciting to see the process of
                        building a game in Unity.</p>

                    <h3>Mobile Data Narrative</h3>
                    <p>GIMM has also a heavy focus on web development skills as well. For this project, I created a
                        website that is supposed to show data collected. I made the site about the different categories
                        of animals that I sell at my job at Petco. The site contains tables and graphs that can be
                        filtered and altered. This project taught me much about how to code websites with HTML, CSS,
                        Javascript, and Node.js. HTML and CSS was used to create the structure and appearance of the
                        site, while Javascript and Node was used to create the functionality of the D3 graphs. This
                        project was definitely stressful as it was a lot of new things to learn all at once, but it was
                        very satisfying when it all came together and functioned properly.</p>

                    <h3>Unity 3D Photo Gallery</h3>
                    <p>This project was my first time ever working with Unity 3D. This project is a 3D art gallery that
                        lets the player walk around and look at different photos on the walls and see information about
                        each photo. For this, I used picutres of my pets. When the player walks up to a photo, they wll
                        see text explaining the photo appear on their screen. This project taught me about setting up
                        lighting, textures, and first person controls in Unity. I am hoping to build on these skills to
                        learn more about wokring in 3D.

                    <h3>Interactive Comic</h3>
                    <p>This project was a group assignment where we were given an abstract topic, and told to make an
                        interactive comic about it. The topic we were given was "The Emptiness of an Atom". We decided
                        to make our story about a lone atom who gets told that by himself, he has no value and is
                        worthless by a chemistry teacher. The atom then goes on a journey of self discovery and learns
                        that while he may not be much on his own, he is capable of great things when working together
                        with other atoms. The comic involves the reader having to collect hidden atoms around each panel
                        in order to unlock the ending. This project was made mostly in Unity while the animations were
                        done using Photoshop and Adobe Animate. This project was my first ever dive into animation and
                        taught me a lot about 2D animating practices.</p>

                    <h3>Unity Leap Frog Game</h3>
                    <p>Here we have a project that I made using Unity 3D. This is a 3D leap frog game that can be played
                        with 2 people on one device. The goal for the players is to jump over each other to score
                        points. There are many obstacles and things to climb on around the arena that players can use to
                        get above their opponent. There are towers of movable cubes as well that let the players climb
                        or topple over. If you cause the tower to fall on your opponent then thats a point! This game
                        allows 2 players because player 1 uses the WASD keys to move and the left Shift to jump, while
                        player 2 uses the IJKL keys to move and right Shift to jump. This project was made entirely in
                        Unity. 3D games and environments are what I want to keep wokring on the most as I go into the future.
